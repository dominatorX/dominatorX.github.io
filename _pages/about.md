## Research
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Dr. WANG has been working on "Building Humanâ€‘Cognition-Inspired Data Pipeline for AI," offering data-centric solutions to bridge current AI-user gaps. Our focus is on data preparation for frontier Large Language Models, KV cache, and vector databases to improve application effectiveness across various areas. Rather than simply enhancing specific metrics, we enrich AI models with human intuition from a data perspective, including:
